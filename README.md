**Abstract**:
Previous works by Yi et al. [1] and others have established the potential for ML-based channel estimators to outperform 
classical channel estimators by accounting for non-linearities and non-idealities. However, a preliminary investigation 
in [2] showed that some inputs to the neural network contribute minimally to performance. Power and computational 
limitations limit the feasibility of real-time DL-based channel estimators. As a result, it is imperative that such 
models only use necessary input data and be of the minimum complexity required to achieve the desired performance. We 
investigate the application of feature engineering and selection to deep neural networks to improve performance and 
decrease model complexity in terms of the input dimensionality, and the number of parameters.
